[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/jdnavarro/smallcheck-laws.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jdnavarro/smallcheck-laws)

[`smallcheck`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/smallcheck) properties for
the following laws:

- Monoid
- Functor
- Applicative
- Monad

Use this package to create your own fine tuned `smallcheck` tests. For
preassembled test runners with minimal setup and sensible defaults, you can use
[`tasty-laws`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-laws).
